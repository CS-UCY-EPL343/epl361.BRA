Description
------------
The "Broadway Restaurant Application" is an Android-powered portable Android Application that will serve four different functions for the owner of Broadway Restaurant at Kokkinotrimithia, Nicosia, Cyprus. The first function concerns an order system, where each waiter will handle orders via a portable device. Its purpose is to record the orders, which will be sent to the Database and to inform the user whether there are any orders ready for delivery. The second function concerns a system for informing the kitchen about the pending orders as well as informing the database from the kitchen about the orders that are ready for delivery. The third function concerns the cash register which will also work on Android and will be directly connected to the system. It will be also responsible for calculating the change for the clients of the company for each order. The fourth function is the manager's entry into the system that will have access to Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Time Reports for Sales and Orders as well as managing the User and Menu database.

Instructions
-----------
In order to run the application you have to either use an Android emulator (Android Studio is recomended), or install the application to a mobile phone. For the purposes of this phase of the project, the database is not linked to the application, therefore some functions are not fully functional.

Specifically, when creating or editing an order, only the first category (Side) is enabled and only the first item in that category (Halloumi Cheese).

Moreover, for the same purposes , there are only 3 users, each given a different role to the system. The users have no passwords and their username is stated as follow:

Role: Username
- Manager: 1 
- Waiter: 2
- Cook: 3
